${symbol_pound} Here you can override the default messages provided by the Hibernate validator,
${symbol_pound} change messages provided by ExpressUI validators and add new custom validation messages.

${symbol_pound} IMPORTANT: messages loaded directly by Hibernate (rather than Spring) do not support UTF-8, which
${symbol_pound} means you must escape certain characters with unicode. For example, Ã¼ would be \u00FC.
${symbol_pound} See full list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters. You can also convert
${symbol_pound} a whole file using the JDK tool: native2ascii.
${symbol_pound} This is not necessary for those validation messages loaded by Spring rather than JSR 303,
${symbol_pound} since Spring automatically supports UTF-8.
